<pre><strong><strong>
Description, qualifying comments, and acceptable water years.</strong>

Drainage area is 52.6 sq.mi.                            Datum is 68.69 ft.
Located in hydrologic unit 02060002 at Latitude: 39:39:26N  Longitude: 075:49:20W

Stream length is 23.30 miles
Mean basin elevation is 398.00 feet above National Geodetic Vertical Datum
Percent of contributing drainage area covered by 
   Storage: 0.05%     Lakes: N.A.%        Forests: 14.00%     Glaciers: N.A.%
Soil infiltration index is 3.70 inches
Annual precipitation is 44.00 inches
Precipitation intensity is 3.25 inches/24 hour (expected on the average once each two years)

<strong>Comments and qualifications on the data:
   Records are unsuitable for analysis at less than monthly resolution due to minor diurnal fluctuations caused by
   upstream mills. In 1936, several missing data values were assigned average monthly discharge values estimated from
   discharge at nearby streams.
</strong>

Monthly and longer averages for 56 water years are acceptable (all years except partial years).
A water year with acceptable data is indicated by an asterisk in the time line, which spans 1874 through 1988.
