<strong>Comments and qualifications on the data:
   Records are unsuitable for analysis at less than monthly resolution due to minor regulation by upstream reservoirs,
   beginning with the completion of East Sidney Lake in 1950. Months with constant discharge values, in 1915 and 1928,
   are indicative of estimated average monthly discharge during periods of icing or recorder failure.
</strong>

Monthly and longer averages for 75 water years are acceptable (all years except partial years).
A water year with acceptable data is indicated by an asterisk in the time line, which spans 1874 through 1988.
