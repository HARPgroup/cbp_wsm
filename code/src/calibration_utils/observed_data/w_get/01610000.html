<strong>Comments and qualifications on the data:
   Records are not suitable for analysis at less than monthly resolution because there is a minor effect on low flow
   by several distant upstream reservoirs. Starting with water year 1981, high flows have been affected by dam
   upstream.
</strong>

Monthly and longer averages for 42 water years are acceptable (some whole years and all partial years are excluded).
A water year with acceptable data is indicated by an asterisk in the time line, which spans 1874 through 1988.
