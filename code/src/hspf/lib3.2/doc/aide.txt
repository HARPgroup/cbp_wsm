NAME
       aide - ANNIE Interaction Development Environment

ABSTRACT
       AIDE provides a consistent methodology for building character-based
       user interfaces for environmental software.  Potential applications
       range from generating input files from user-supplied data for
       already existing scientific or environmental models to allowing user
       access to data bases for the purpose of searching, analyzing, or
       displaying data values.  AIDE provides applications programmers with
       the tools needed to build and store a convenient user interface
       whenever and wherever there is a need to perform one or more of the
       following operations:

           o  display text
           o  prompt the user to select a menu option
           o  prompt the user to input or edit data fields
           o  open a file to store or retrieve text and other information

       The advantages gained by using AIDE for interface development center
       on four concepts:  modularity, consistency, portability, and ease of
       application.  The system utilizes a library of routines to perform
       the basic communications functions between the user and the program.
       Repeated use of these subroutines allows the programmer to focus
       attention on designing an effective sequence of interactions while
       minimizing the effort needed to program the more mechanical aspects
       of the interface.  At the same time, the repeated use of modular
       routines decreases the likelihood of introducing programming errors.

       The AIDE library is included in the LIB distribution.  It requires
       the util and adwdm libraries from the LIB distribution.

METHOD
       The user interface was developed under the guidance of Dr. Albert
       Badre of the Georgia Institute of Technology who provided expertise
       on human-computer interaction.  The established theory and practice
       of user interfaces were used.

HISTORY
       AIDE is a redesign of the interfaces from the original ANNIE program
       and the Environmental Model Input File Editor (EMIFE).  The AIDE
       user interface was developed under the guidance of Dr.  Albert Badre
       of the Georgia Institute of Technology who provided expertise on
       human-computer interaction.  The established theory and practice of
       user interfaces were used.  The original AIDE implementation was
       funded by EPA (1989).  Additional features were added by the USGS
       (1992).

       Version 3.1 1996/12/11 - Updates

       Version 3.0 1996/03/01 - Include file names changed to lower case.
          Increased maximum number of fields on a screen from 60 to 180.
          File type data field added.

       Version 2.1 1994/08/11 - Updates

       Version 2.0 1994/05/27 - General release

       Version 1.0 1992 - General release, ported to UNIX platform.

       NOTE:  Version numbers and dates are for the entire LIB set of
             libraries.  A new version does not necessarily indicate that
             the AIDE library has been changed.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       AIDE is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension: use of
       include files. The AIDE library requires the ADWDM and UTIL
       libraries.

DOCUMENTATION
       A subroutine reference guide is provided in the distribution.
