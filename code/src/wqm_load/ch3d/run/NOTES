Input to the hydrodynamic model consists of two files.

file 13 contains the observed inputs.
  This file is not yet generated, but a program could easily be
    written that would use the file ../link/gages_rivers.prn
    to make the connection.
  If simulated inputs are used at the observed stations, than this 
    file should be remade with model output at the fall line
    which is different than the gage station so it will
    take some careful setup.

File 33 contains the simulated inputs which are in addition to
    the observed inputs.
  The linkage is in ../link/distributed_flows_no_gages.prn
  If using only simulated inputs then this file should be modified
    at the simulated stations or combined into one file.
  The main difference between 33 and 13 is that momentum is taken
    into account in file 13 and not in file 33.

To generate the inputs to the hydro model, run the run_p5_to_ch3d.com
  script.  It takes the arguments of the base directory (like p507)
  and the scenario.

This is getting close to the water quality link, but it will be
  necessary to make a new file like 
    ./pp/catalog/iovars/rchres_out_to_load

  and some reprogramming to keep all of the variables other than
  flow.  basically, the pairq variable will have to be expanded
   and indexed to the number of output variables.

  Also, the fall line station for flow is not always the fall line
    station for water quality, most notably in the James.

################ how to run inputs
 run_p5_fall_line.com $root $rscen  
   - short run time, just gets the fall lines
 run_p5_to_ch3d.com $root $rscen
   - long run time (hour), gets distributed and non-RIM 0001's

 to combine these in one run and one file, copy distributed_flows_with_gages.prn
   to distributed_flows.prn and only run run_p5_to_ch3d.com

 check the file(s) check_flows.prn and [check_gaged_flows.prn] for 
   reasonableness
