NAME
       util - Manipulating character strings, numbers, and dates

ABSTRACT
       Over 100 routines are contained in the UTIL library.  Routines from
       this library are currently used by more than 25 programs. The
       library contains a mix of basic utility routines for manipulating
       character strings, retrieving and calculating various items
       associated with dates and time, sorting arrays, copying arrays,
       writing text to the screen, and reading text from the screen. This
       code is generally well documented, both internally and in separate
       documentation.

       The UTIL library is included in the LIB distribution.

HISTORY
       Version 3.1 1996/12/11 - Corrected how function CNVTDG converted
          degree-minute-second latitudes and longitudes to decimal degrees.

       Version 3.0 1996/03/01 - Include file names changed to lower case.
          Renamed routines that return current date and time, date, and
          time to SYDATM, SYDATE, and SYTIME, respectively (had been
          DATNOW, JULDAT, and GETIME).

       Version 2.1 1994/08/11 - Updates

       Version 2.0 1994/05/27 - General release

       Version 1.0 1992 - General release, ported to UNIX platform.

       NOTE: Version numbers and dates are for the entire LIB set of
             libraries.  A new version does not necessarily indicate that
             all of the libraries have changed.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       UTIL is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension: use of
       include files. UTIL contains three routines that call system date
       and (or) time routines.  Versions are provided for Data General,
       Sun, PC (Lahey), Silicon Graphics, DEC, and Prime.

DOCUMENTATION
       A subroutine reference guide is provided in the distribution.
