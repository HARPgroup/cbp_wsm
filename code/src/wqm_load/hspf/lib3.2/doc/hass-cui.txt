NAME
       hass-cui - Character-Based User Interface Used by HASS

ABSTRACT
       A character-based user interface (CUI) has been used for
       various programs supported by the Hydrologic Analysis
       Software Support (HASS) Team to enhance and facilitate
       program use.  The interface provides for consistent user
       interaction across hydrologic applications.  The system
       was designed for ease of programming and for portability
       to mini-computers and PC's as well as UNIX workstations.

USER INTERFACE
       Program interaction takes place in a screen 80 characters
       wide by 24 characters high.  Figure 1 shows the basic
       screen layout.  Each screen consists of a list of
       available commands displayed at the bottom of the screen
       and one or more boxed-in areas that are referred to as
       panels. Commands are used to obtain additional information
       and to move between screens. There are three types of
       panels--data, assistance, and instruction. The data panel
       displayed at the top of the screen is always present. Data
       panels contain menus, forms, tables, and text to permit
       user interaction with the program. An assistance panel may
       be present depending on user or program assignments. When
       present, the assistance panel is displayed below the data
       panel (usually as the middle panel) and contains textual
       information, such as help messages, valid range of values,
       and details on program status. The instruction panel is
       displayed above the available commands when the user is
       expected to interact with the program. When present, the
       instruction panel contains information on what keystrokes
       are required to interact with the program.

       Each screen can be identified by a name and the path
       selected to reach the screen. The screen name appears in
       the upper left corner of the data panel, where the words
       "screen name" appear in figure 1. The first screen
       displayed by the program is named "Opening screen". All
       subsequent screens are named based on the menu option or
       program sequence that caused the current screen to be
       displayed. Screen names are followed by "(path)", a string
       of characters consisting of the first letter(s) of the
       menu options selected in order to arrive at the current
       screen. In some cases, descriptive text may follow the
       path to further help identify the screen. The path can aid
       in keeping track of the position of the current screen in
       the menu hierarchy. For example, "Open (FO)" indicates
       that the menu option Open was selected previously and that
       the path to this screen from the "Opening screen"
       consisted of two menu selections--File and Open.

       The screen commands and their associated keystrokes are
       described in table 1. A subset of the screen commands is
       available for any given screen. Most commands can be
       executed by pressing a single function key. (The
       designation for a function key is "F#" where # is the
       number of the function key.) All of the commands can be
       executed in "command mode". Command mode is toggled on and
       off by pressing the semicolon (;) key. In command mode,
       any command can be executed by pressing the first letter
       of the command name; for example, "o" or "O" for the Oops
       command. When commands are discussed in this report, the
       command name is spelled out with the function key or
       keystroke given in parentheses. For example, Accept (F2)
       is the most frequently used command.

       Use Help (F1) and Limits (F5) to obtain additional
       information about the current screen and use Status (F7)
       to obtain information on the state of the program. Cmhlp
       (;c) will display information on the available commands.
       Use Quiet (F8) to close the assistance panel. To move
       between screens, use Accept (F2), Prev (F4), Intrpt (F6),
       Dnpg (;d), Uppg (;u), or Top (F10). To reset the values in
       the data panel, use Oops (;o). Xpad (F9) is used to save
       typed information in a file called XPAD.DAT.

       Data Panel

       There are four types of data panels--menu, form, table,
       and text. Menus offer a choice of two or more options.
       Data values are entered or modified in one or more data
       fields of a form or table. General or specific
       information, program progress, messages, and results of
       analyses may be displayed in a text data panel. The data
       panel appears at the top of the screen, as shown in figure
       1. There are 16 rows in the data panel when the assistance
       panel is closed and 10 rows when the assistance panel is
       open.

       A single option is selected from a menu that consists of
       two or more options. There are two ways to select a menu
       option. Either press the first letter (not case sensitive)
       of the menu option; if more than one menu option begins
       with the same letter, press in sequence enough characters
       to uniquely identify the option; or use the arrow keys to
       move the cursor to the option and then execute Accept
       (F2).

       Forms may contain any number and combination of character,
       numeric, file name, or option fields. Character fields may
       be a variable entry, such as a descriptive text string
       (case sensitive), or they may require a specific entry,
       such as "yes" or "no" (not case sensitive). The text
       string "none" in a field indicates that the field is
       currently undefined.  Option fields are activated and



                           20 May 1997                          4

       deactivated by positioning the cursor in the option field
       and pressing any key, such as the space bar. Use arrow
       keys to move up, down, and laterally between fields. The
       Enter (Return) key is used to move forward through fields.
       Use Accept (F2) to accept the entered and modified data
       and continue with the program.  Executing Oops (;o) sets
       all fields in the current screen to their initial values.
       Executing Prev (F4) will cause the data values entered on
       the current screen to be ignored and the previous screen
       to be redisplayed.

       Tables may contain any number and combination of
       character, numeric, and file name columns. As with forms,
       character fields may require a specific entry or a
       variable entry.  Use arrow keys to move up, down, and
       laterally between fields. The Enter (Return) key is used
       to move forward across rows and to the next row. Some
       tables may contain more rows than can be displayed in the
       10 or 16 rows of the data panel. In these cases, the table
       is divided into multiple screens. Use Accept (F2) to move
       forward through each of the screens for the table and to
       continue with the program after the last screen of the
       table. Executing Oops (;o) sets all fields in the current
       screen to their initial values.  Executing Prev (F4) will
       cause the data values entered on the current screen to be
       ignored and the previous screen to be redisplayed.
       Executing Intrpt (F6) will cause the data values entered
       on the current screen to be ignored and the remaining
       screens in the table to be skipped. Use Quiet (F8) to
       close the assistance panel and view the 16 lines of the
       data panel.

       A text data panel may contain a warning or error message,
       a tabular list of data, a progress message for an activity
       that may take more than a few seconds, or other general
       information. Execute Accept (F2) to continue to the next
       screen. In cases where the displayed text requires more
       lines than the number available in the data panel, the
       Prev (F4), Dnpg (;d), and Uppg (;u) commands may be
       available to move forward and backward (scroll) through
       the screens. Note that the up and down arrows also may be
       used to move through the screens. Intrpt (F6) may be
       available to permit skipping the remaining screens of
       text.

       Assistance Panel

       The assistance panel provides information to help the user
       enter data in the data panel or to allow note taking
       during a program session. The panel appears in the middle
       of the screen below the data panel. A name corresponding
       to the type of assistance being provided displays in the
       upper left corner of the panel, where the words
       "assistance type" appear in figure 1. The Help (F1),



                           20 May 1997                          5





hass-cui(1)      U.S. Geological Survey (wrdapp)      hass-cui(1)


       Limits (F5), Status (F7), Cmhlp (;c), and Xpad (F9)
       commands open the assistance panel. The program may open
       the assistance panel to display status information. Help
       and Limits provide information about the current screen
       and data fields; Status provides information about the
       current process; Cmhlp provides information about the
       available commands; and Xpad provides a "note pad" for
       making notes in the file XPAD.DAT. Use Quiet (F8) to close
       the assistance panel.

       Assistance panels display four lines at a time. In cases
       where the assistance information is greater than four
       lines, the cursor moves into the assistance panel. Use the
       up and down arrow keys to scroll through the information.
       If available, the Page Down and Page Up keys may be used
       to page through the information. Use the command mode
       toggle (;) to put the cursor back in the data panel.

       Instruction Panel

       The instruction panel provides information on how to
       interact with the current screen, such as how to enter
       data or how to advance to another screen. This panel
       appears at the bottom of the screen just above the screen
       commands (fig. 1). The instruction panel is present
       whenever the program requires input from the user. Up to
       four lines of text are displayed in an instruction panel.
       If an invalid keystroke is entered, the information in the
       instruction panel is replaced with an error message. In
       this case, the panel name (upper left hand corner) changes
       from the usual "INSTRUCT" to "ERROR." Once a valid
       keystroke is entered, the Instruct panel is redisplayed.


SPECIAL FILES
       Three files are associated with the interaction between
       the user and the program. System defaults that control how
       the program operates can be overridden by setting
       parameters in the optional TERM.DAT file. A session record
       is written to the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file each time the
       program is run; all or portions of this file can be used
       as input to the program at a later time. Error and warning
       messages, as well as some additional information, may be
       written to the file ERROR.FIL.

       System Defaults--TERM.DAT

       Certain aspects of the appearance and operation of the
       program are controlled by parameters within the program.
       These parameters specify things such as the computer
       system type, graphic output type, terminal type, program
       response to the Enter key, and colors. Each parameter is
       set based on the preferences of users who tested the
       program.  The preset values can be overridden by creating



                           20 May 1997                          6

       a TERM.DAT file in the directory where the program is
       initiated (the current working directory). The available
       parameters and the format of the TERM.DAT file are
       described in Appendix B. If a TERM.DAT file does not exist
       in the current directory, the message "optional TERM.DAT
       file not opened, defaults will be used" is displayed
       briefly when the program starts. If the TERM.DAT file is
       present, the message "reading users system parameters from
       TERM.DAT" is displayed.

       Session Record--PROGRAM_NAME.LOG

       The keystrokes entered during a program session are
       recorded in the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file.  Each time the
       program is run, an PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file is created; if
       one already exists in the current directory, it is
       overwritten. All or part of this file can be used as input
       to the program as a means of repeating the same or similar
       tasks. To do this, first save the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file
       under a different name. Modify the file to contain only
       the sequence of commands that need to be repeated. Then,
       at any point in a subsequent program session, press "@"; a
       small file name panel appears; type the name of the log
       file and press the Enter key. Appendix B describes the use
       and format of the PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file.

       Error and Warning Messages--ERROR.FIL

       Any error or warning messages produced during a program
       session are written to the ERROR.FIL file. Each time the
       program is run, an ERROR.FIL file is created; if one
       already exists in the current directory, it is
       overwritten. Diagnostic and summary reports also may be

       Many of the TERM.DAT parameters control graphical output
       and give the user the opportunity to change graphics
       devices, text fonts, symbol sizes, and background color.
       The values assigned to the graphics parameters depend on
       the software library used for graphics generation. On
       UNIX-based computers, the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) is
       used. The user should note that the graphics parameter
       values used for GKS as supplied by different vendors will
       not be the same; the documentation for the user's
       implementation of GKS should be consulted. On DOS-based
       computers, the INTERACTER graphics library from
       Interactive Software Services is used for graphics
       generation. See the README file distributed with the
       program for the most current information on producing
       graphical output using INTERACTER.

       Table 2.2 lists TERM.DAT parameters with their allowable
       values and their default values when using the program on
       a DOS-based computer, on a Data General computer under
       DG/UX, and on other UNIX-based computers. Table 2.3 lists
       TERM.DAT parameters specific to screen color assignment on
       DOS-based computers. The final table, 2.4, shows an
       example TERM.DAT file that modifies the background color
       of the graphics screen display from the default of black
       to a shade of purple.

       Special files

       Each time the program is run, two files are produced that
       aid in troubleshooting and in future program
       execution--ERROR.FIL and PROGRAM_NAME.LOG.

       The ERROR.FIL file contains any error messages produced
       while running the program.  Diagnostic and progress
       messages may be written to this file to aid in debugging.
       This file should be consulted if an unexpected program
       response is encountered.

       The PROGRAM_NAME.LOG file contains a log of all keystrokes
       made while running the program.  This record of keystrokes
       is helpful when the program is repeatedly used to perform
       the same functions.  The file can be used as input to the
       program; the keystrokes are read from the file as if they
       were typed in.  To use the file in this way, first change
       its name to something other than PROGRAM_NAME.LOG to
       prevent the file from being overwritten the next time the
       program is started.  On any screen within the program,
       type "@" to be prompted for the log file name.  The
       contents of the file will be read and executed as
       appropriate.

       The first line in the log file should be an appropriate
       response to the screen where the name of the log file is
       provided. Occasionally, the log file contents will get out
       of sync with the input expected by the program.  When this
       happens, the program should be terminated and the log file
       should be edited to correctly order the responses.

       Log files are most easily created by using the program for
       the processes to be repeated and then modifying the log
       file for future program execution.  Alphabetic keys
       pressed will be recorded in the log file in the manner in
       which they were typed.  Nonprinting keys that are pressed,
       such as the function keys, the semicolon, the arrow keys,
       or the Page Up and Page Down keys, will be represented in
       the log file by a unique code number preceded by a pound
       sign ("#").  These code numbers are listed in the table
       below.  When planning to use a log file, you will discover
       it is easier to interpret the file when a menu option is
       chosen by entering the first letter of the menu option
       instead of by pressing the Enter or F2 key.

METHOD
       The user interface was developed under the guidance of Dr.
       Albert Badre of the Georgia Institute of Technology who
       provided expertise on human-computer interaction.  The
       established theory and practice of user interfaces were
       used.

       referenced below have been made by the U.S. Geological
       Survey (USGS) and Environmental Protection Agency.  The
       USGS maintains the latest version.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
       The sole input requirement for a user of the interface is
       a keyboard with or without function keys and arrow keys.
       A mouse is not used with the interface.  The input
       requirements for a programmer adding the interface to an
       existing application are an ASCII file of screen
       directives that describe the contents, layout, and help
       information for each screen, and the corresponding Fortran
       subroutine calls for display of the screens.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       UNIX-based computers (supported:  Data General AViiON and

       Sun SPARCstation).

       DOS-based computers having a math coprocessor and 4 mb of
       memory (supported: IBM-compatible computers with a 386 or
       greater processor).

       HASS-CUI is written in Fortran and C.  Generally, HASS-CUI
       applications are easily installed on other platforms.

APPLICATIONS
       HASS-CUI is the user interface for a number of USGS
       supported programs, including:

       ANNIE - Program to list, table, plot data in a WDM file
       GLSNET - Regional hydrologic regression and network
                analysis using generalized least squares
       HSPEXP - Expert system for calibration of HSPF
       IOWDM - Program to store time-series data in a WDM file
       PEAKFQ - Flood-frequency analysis based on Bulletin 17B
       SWSTAT - Surface-Water Statistics

       HASS-CUI is also used in a number of programs supported by
       the Environmental Protection Agency.

WARNINGS
       On UNIX-based computers, a monospaced font with a vt100
       line-drawing set must be used in order for all panel
       borders to be displayed properly.  For X Window System
       users, most of the X Window miscellaneous fixed fonts will
       work well, in particular 8x13bold, 9x15bold, and 10x20.

       Users of DOS-based computers must load ANSI.SYS in their
       CONFIG.SYS file for panel borders and text to be displayed
       properly.
