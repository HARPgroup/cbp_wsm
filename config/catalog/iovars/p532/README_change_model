The files in this directory specify the land use variables, 
  the river variables, and the correspondance between them

FILE		NOTES
perlnd		pervious land variables with DSNs, HSPF name, nickname,
		land uses using this variable, and description.

implnd		impervious land variables with DSNs, HSPF name, nickname,
                land uses using this variable, and description.

rchres_in	river input variables with DSNs, HSPF name, nickname,
		and description.

rchres_out_1x	same as rchres_in but with different HSPF names and
                DSNs.  Use for rivers with only one exit.

rchres_out_Nx	same as rchres_in but with different HSPF names and
                DSNs.  Use for rivers with more than one exit.

land_to_river	used to replace MASS-LINK in HSPF.  This file shows
		river DSN and nickname to land DSN and nickname,
		using a factor where appropriate and specifying the
		land uses where it applies.


The following files pertain to output formats

FILE			NOTES
rchres_out_to_annual	rchres variables related to standard output variables
                        Any tables that are output are in terms of the
         		variables specified under 'VALU'a	
			These variables should agree with those in
                        pp/lib/catalogs/data/*_to_eos

rchres_out_to_daily	output specifier for concentrations rather than load.
			the plot name should correspond to observed variables.

NOTE:   land variables go first into river format and are then interpreted
	using the rchres_out_to_annual file

The file delivery_ratio_calc puts the 'VALUs' in rchres_out_to_annual into
   bins to be added together and equated.
