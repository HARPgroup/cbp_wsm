COMMENTS:

point sources in wdms are in HSPF-type units.  No factors necessary

in the programs that create the wdms and data files, the TSS is reduced
  by the fraction of BOD assumed to be biomass or 0.505
The PSWQ was clear that a good portion of the measured TSS is VSS
  and so we subtract the VSS from TSS before putting it in as clay
