Subject: Organic Phosphorus is complicated, read this carefully

Here.s the deal:

The PHOS subroutines only simulate outflow of Sorbed Refractory Organic P

That leaves dissolved refractory organic P, sorbed labile organic P and dissolved labile organic P.  For these, we use a ratio from organic N when loading into the river.  The total output of P is not what gets into the land WDMs from the ../pp/catalog/iovars/perlnd. file, but what gets into the river in the ../pp/catalog/iovars/land_to_river. file.  Carefully reading both of those files and the .rchres_out_to_cali. file with the comments at the end will show how this goes together.

The HSPF standard molar conversion from P to N is 16, giving a mass ratio of 0.1384.
Therefore to get the total P you have to account for the other species of organic P by ratios of organic N

Our list of P constituents is:
spo4
bpo4
slorp
blorp
srorp
brorp

Using names from the .perlnd. file
srorp = DORP + 0.1384 * (SRON+IRON) = 0.1384 * (part of slorn)
brorp = 0.1384 * ARON = 0.1384 * brorn
slorp = 0.1384 * (DLON+SLON+ILON) = 0.1384 * slorn
blorp = 0.1384 * ALON = 0.1384 * blorn

This also means that brorp, slorp, and blorp are completely constrained by the nitrogen calibration.

Jing, you should only calibrate targets for spo4, bpo4, and srorp

Rob, you should calculate srorp as follows:  set the brorp, slorp, and blorp as above. You have TP for each segment.  Subtract everything else to get srorp and make sure that it is positive.

We will probably have to have a few iterations before we have it down completely.

I am changing the land_to_river file in your directories since it had some incorrect ratios and I.ll put this file in that directory as well.
