This is the section that contains all of the information on model parameters
Two files in this directory contain the names of variables stored in 
    tables under ./pp/param

The file 'tables' has an exhaustive list of table names, header lines, 
    and variables.
The header lines, including the variable name line are all comments 
    (have '***').  
The variable line has a 'V' as the third character.  
The line with the name of the table has the format in specified column.  The 
    table format follows the fortran formatting.  If the format is not a simple 
    n[f,i]x format, then the string 'unique' or just 'u' is used.  The format 
    for this table requires special coding in the pp/[l,r]ug/src/tables.f file.

The file 'rivtables' is the same file for rivers.

The parameters for each land use are contained in the directory of the same 
    land use name.
Each module has its own comma delimited file.
