Calibrate this like pwater, using the same land-water method.

There will be 24 sensitivities, which are the needed temperature adjustment for the 15 days before and
  after the first of each month, possibly offset 1-7 days, for both baseflow and stormflow

LGTP1 will be sensitive to baseflow, while ASLT and ULTP1 will be sensitive to stormflow. 


Different trials can assume different offsets, relationships between ASLT and ULTP1, and BSLTs and ULTP2s

SLTMP = ASLT + BSLT*AIRTC         (surface)
ULTMP = ULTP1 + ULTP2*AIRTC       (upper layer)
LL&GWTMP = LGTP1                  (Lower Layer and Ground Water)  
Also make sure to set the lower and gw starting temperature the same as the january LGTP1
PSTEMP-TEMPS    LGTMP

all calibrated values will be constant over land uses.  The groundwater temperature LGTP1 will be the
  same for all land uses as will the intercepts ASLT and ULTP1.

There will be differences in the BSLT and ULTP2 by land use.  These will be set in the 'factors' file
