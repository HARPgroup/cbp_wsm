to change the mechanism of nutrient simulation from agchem to pqual requires several steps

 ./pp/data/  - may have to add to files here if expecting special actions
               see documentation for this section

 ./pp/src/lib/inc/piqual.inc - If this must be changed to accomodate new
                constituents, the rest of the changes are more complicated.
                Leave this alone if at all possible.

 ./pp/param/ - get the correct parameter files in the directories.
               The easiest way is to copy from othe land uses. If changes were
               made in piqual.inc, change all PQUAL land uses to match.

 ./pp/catalog/iovars/perlnd - Make the appropriate connections.  This step must
                be done very carefully.  A mistake will probably not cause a
                run-time error, but would probably result in inconsistencies
                between what is reported as EOS, what gets into a RCHRES, and
                what is in the PLTGENs.  If changes were made in piqual.inc, 
                you must change all PQUAL land uses.
                The trick here is that you must simulate all PQUAL constituents
                to simulate any PQUAL constituents.  You do not have to connect
                them to output variables in this file, however.  Any variables
                not connected will be simulated but will only appear in the
                .out file and any PLTGENs specified in the control file.  They
                will not end up in the output.

 ./run/control/land - change the control files to call the correct subroutines
                         in the MODULES section and change the PLTGENs to call
                         the appropriate modules.  If changes were made in 
                         piqual.inc, you must change all PQUAL land uses.
