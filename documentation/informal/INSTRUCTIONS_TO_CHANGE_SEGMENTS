to change the segmentation:

1. In ./pp/catalog/connect/
calibsites.prn lists river segments that will be output on a daily basis
landnames.prn is a list of land segments and the geographic name
land_water_connect.csv is the list of land segments for each river
rivernames.csv is the list of river segments and the geographic name
rivers.prn is a list of rivers segment names
water_water_connect.csv lists river segments and the upstream segment (this should go away)
wqloadsites.prn is the list of rivers segments that go to the water quality model (this will be unnecessary)

2. In ./pp/catalog/data/
river_met_wdm.csv and river_prad_wdm.csv give met and precip/atdep wdm for each river

3. In ./pp/param/river/
gen_info_rseg.csv gives the number of exits and the lakeflag for each river

4.  In ./pp/param/
change land_evap for the ET modifier
change all parameter files in all subdirectories

5. In ./wdm/
generate or rename all wdms for all categories

6. In ./pp/data/
 generate or modify all files in this directory
