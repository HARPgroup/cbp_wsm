   3.2    98/06/29  Corrected problem introduced with April 6, 1998 revision
                    in wdexpt.f, which increased the precision of data values
                    exported from wdm time-series data sets.  wdimpt.f has
                    been modified to correctly read the exported data values.
                    In some cases the leftmost significant digit of data
                    values was not read (for example, 0.01 may have been
                    read as 0.0).

   3.2    98/03/06  Modified util/utdate.f to correct problem with determining
                    the earliest or latest date from an array of dates.
                    Modified wdm/wdimpt.f to clarify a warning message.
                    Modified hspf/posvm.inc, which had a dimension that limited
                    the number of quality constituents that could be modeled
                    Modified adwdm/attr251.seq and attr401.seq for changes
                    related to swstat program.  Modified wdm/wdexpt.f to
                    change the precision of data values exported from wdm
                    time-series data sets.  Modified awstat/tscmpr.f to
                    correctly calculate total mean absolute error and root
                    mean square error (both percents.)

                    In utdate.f, the subroutine dlimit was incorrectly finding
                    the earliest (or latest) date in an array of dates.  The
                    correct value was returned only if it happened to be the
                    first or last date in the array.  This is now corrected to
                    find the date anywhere in the array.  This change will 
                    affect any program that used this subroutine, in particular
                    annie and swstat.

                    In wdimpt.f, subroutine prwmti, any non-zero return code
                    would cause an error message to be printed.  In many
                    cases, no real problem existed, so the error was changed
                    to a warning.  This message was noticed in annie and wdimex
                    when importing data sets into a wdm file.

                    In posvm.inc, the parameter posvsz was set to 2500.  It
                    has been increased to 6000.  When quality was being
                    simulated, 2500 was not large enough to hold all the
                    parameters for each rchres needed in the osvm array
                    (cosv.inc).  This problem could be seen in the programs
                    hspf, hspexp, and genscn.

                    Added text to definition of attributes SEASBG and SEASND
                    in attr251.seq.  Added attributes SEADBG and SEADND to
                    attr401.seq.  SEASBG and SEASND define the start and end
                    months of a year or season.  SEADBG and SEADND have been
                    added to further defind the season or year to specific
                    beginning and ending days.

                    When data was being exported from time-series data sets,
                    the precision being used was 4 significant digits.
                    This had been adequate for the applications that used
                    the data in the past.  Recently, some users have found
                    that they need greater precision.  The software will
                    now generate data to 6 significant digits.  The output
                    format was modified in wdm/wdexpt.f

                    When two time series were being compared, the total
                    mean absolute error (percent) and root mean square
                    error (percent) were being incorrectly computed
                    (awstat.tscmpr.f).  It can be observed that the
                    values originally computed were not consistent with
                    the values computed for the individual classes.
             

   3.1    96/12/11  Modified util/utgnrl.f and wdm/wdatru.f.

                    The function CNVTDG in util/utgnrl.f is used to
                    convert degree-minute-second latitudes and longitudes
                    to decimal degrees.  This function was calculating
                    values that were off by a factor of 10.  The function
                    has been re-written to correctly convert the values.
                    This function was known to be used by the peakfq, glsnet,
                    and metcmp programs.  However, in most cases, latitude
                    and longitude are provided in decimal degrees, and
                    the function was not called.  See the program-specific
                    documentation for glsnet and peakfq for information on
                    any problems that may need to be addressed.

                    The new subroutine WDBSGL was added to wdm/wdatru.f.
                    This subroutine can be called to retrieve the latitude
                    and longitude from a wdm data set.  The subroutine will
                    first attempt to retrieve decimal degrees from attributes
                    LATDEG (54) and LNGDEG (55).  If there is a problem
                    with either LATDEG or LNGDEG, the subroutine will look for
                    attributes LATDMS (8) and LNGDMS (9) and convert them to
                    decimal degrees.  If there is a problem with either LATDMS
                    or LNGDMS, the subroutine will look for attributes LATCTR
                    (96) and LNGCTR (97).  If none of these attributes are
                    present, the subroutine will return 0.0 for LAT and LNG
                    and the RETCOD from the attribute retrieval that failed.

   3.0.1  96/07/12  Change made to subroutine GPM in gksint.f in graph.f.
                    GPM used to call a routine called GMARKR, which is
                    no longer included in newer copies of interactor.
                    So instead of keeping two different versions of
                    gksint.f for the two versions of interactor, calls
                    to GMARKR have been changed to GMARK1, which is
                    a part of code group grmark.  Note that this change
                    is applicable only to versions of the program that
                    use the interactor library for graphics.

   3.0    04/15/96  Modified subroutine GSUTPW in grgks.f.  There was
                    a problem with designating an output device in many
                    applications that use graph.  If the user first drew
                    the plot on the screen and then modified the output
                    device to cgm, everything worked fine.  However, if
                    the user initially selected cgm for the ouput device,
                    there was a floating point exception and the program
                    crashed.  The corrections were made specific to the
                    Prior gks library on the Data General.  This problem
                    may not exist for cgm files using other gks libraries.

   3.0    03/01/96  Modified subroutine ucirea to resolve problems opening
                    files identified in a uci file.  Code now checks to
                    see if a file is already open, file is closed if
                    it is open and then re-opened.  Problems had been
                    encountered with Fortran 90 compilers that objected
                    to opening an already open file.  The problem was
                    only apparent in program hspexp.

   3.0    01/17/96  Corrected minimum value for attribute JANMIN in
                    attr051.seq.  Also made a couple of minor editing
                    corrections.

                    The minimum value had been defined as 0.0, this
                    was changed to no minimum value (-999).

                    NOTE:  this correction will affect message files
                           in many programs.

   3.0    08/10/95  Modified subroutine wdtput, constant ALLFLG was
                    changed from 1 to 0.  This affects how new data
                    overwrites existing data.

                    subrroutine grsygn.f was deleted,  Uses grsyux.f
                    instead.

   3.0    06/13/95  made all include file names lower case, resolved any
                    shared include

   3.0    06/05/95  sequential files used by src/ann code groups were
                    moved from annie to msg/ann

   3.0    05/18/95  Revised how text is written to plot.

   3.0    03/30/95  Correction made in hspf simulation of evapotranspiration.

                    There was a problem in subroutine ETLZON with the check
                    to see if there was enough storage in the lower zone
                    to meet the potential.  If not, LZET had been set to
                    the current lower zone storage (LZS), completely emptying
                    the storage, causing an underflow to occur in subroutine
                    SURFAC.  The code was modified to set LZET to LZS - 0.02,
                    leaving a small amount in storage.

                    Code group src/hspf/hperwat.f was modified.

   3.0    11/11/94  Miscellaneous changes.

                    Renamed system-dependent time routines to resolve conflict
                    with COE library routine juldat.  The following system
                    dependent routines are found in dttm[dc dg pc pr sg sn].f
                    in the util directory;

                              DATNOW --> SYDATM
                              JULDAT --> SYDATE
                              GETIME --> SYTIME

                    Code group aide/qtprin.f split into aide-dependent code
                    group aide/prtaid.f and non-aide-dependent adwdm/prtfil.f.

                    Routines FLSETC, QSTBUF, QSTBFB, QGTBUF, & QGTBFB added
                    to qtstgt.f.

   3.0    10/10/94  Miscellaneous changes.

                    Increased the maximum number of fields on a screen from
                    60 to 180.

                    Added new callback routines.
