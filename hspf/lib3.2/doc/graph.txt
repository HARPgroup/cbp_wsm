NAME
       graph - Interface to Graphical Kernel System (GKS)

ABSTRACT
       The GRAPH library contains a set of routines that have been used to
       generate a range of plots in hydrologic applications.  Graphics
       include time plots at scales of minutes to years, x-y plots, and
       probability plots.  Non-time axes can be arithmetic, logarithmic, or
       probability.  Probability plots with Gaussian transformations can be
       fraction, percent, or recurrence interval.  The library was
       developed using the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) standard to
       provide portability.  The GRAPH library is used by ANNIE, GLSNET,
       HSPEXP, HYSEP, PEAKFQ, SWSTAT, and other programs.

       The GRAPH library is included in the LIB distribution.  It requires
       the UTIL and STATS libraries from the LIB distribution.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       GRAPH is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension: use of
       include files. The GRAPH library requires STATS and UTIL libraries.

DOCUMENTATION
       A subroutine reference guide is provided in the distribution.

SUPPORTING SOFTWARE
       The GRAPH library is written using the GKS standard.  An
       implementation of GKS is required for the UNIX platform.  The PC
       version includes a set of routines that translate GKS calls to
       Interactive Software Services's INTERACTER calls.

       GKS libraries are available from a number of vendors.  Free or
       shareware versions are available via anonymous ftp to:
