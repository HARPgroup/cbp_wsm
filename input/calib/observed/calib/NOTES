this data set was created by gary shenk on 8/19/2008
using the script /model/p517/pp/observed/scripts/split_WQ_data.csh
calling the program /model/p517/pp/observed/code/split_all_data_STAC/
which takes the /model/p517/pp/observed/alldata/ data
  and creates the /model/p517/pp/observed/calib/ and 
     /model/p517/pp/observed/validation/ data sets
by taking the last 25% of the data for those segments contained in
 /model/p517/pp/observed/validation_segs.csv
  and putting into the validation data set
all other segments were just copied from 'alldata' to 'calib'

This procedure was recommended by the second STAC phase 5 review of 2/20/2008
