to generate the input for the USGS FAT report:

  1.  Select the scenario.  You can use a real scenario or a dummy
      one if the real one is currently in use.  You'll be generating
      a lot of files in the output/input directory, which you may
      want to delete and you'll be changing the dates in the land
      control file, which may be in use.

  2.  Get the segment lists.  The script all_basingen.csh should
      work just fine.  You may have to edit the script if there
      are changes in the basins.
  2a. For confluence stations (DSID=0003), edit the files to remove
      the downstream segment and change the name to *_0003.riv
                rename.csh PM4_4040_4410 PM4_4040_0003
                rename.csh SJ6_2130_2050 SJ6_2130_0003
                rename.csh SW7_1640_1680 SW7_1640_0003
                rename.csh YM4_6620_0001 YM4_6620_0003
      Edit the new .riv files and remove the last segment
  2b. If the allFAT.land files does not exist or is out of date, 
      generate it by sticking together all of the recently-generated
      .land files.  You can do this using the add script in the 
      seglists directory or in a spreadsheet
  2c. Remove extra .land and .calib seglists to keep the directory
      under control.  Use the remove_extra_seglist_files.csh

  3.  Generate all of the input files in 
      ./output/input/$scenario/  
      Use the script generate_all_inputs.csh
      Check the script to make sure that the scenario is correct.
      Check the control file to make sure that it starts and ends
      in 1985.  This may take most of a day.

  4.  Generate all of the summaries in ./output/basin/$scenario/
      run the allyear_allbasin_summaries.csh, which calls
      allbasin_annual_summaries.csh for each year

  5.  Now generate the point source and septic, create the allFAT.riv
      using the add script in ./run/seglists

  6.  Generate the point source and septic files with the script
      generate_pssep.csh

  7.  Generate all of the pssep in ./output/basin/$scenario/
      run the allyear_allbasin_pssep.csh, which calls
      allbasin_annual_pssep.csh for each year
