variable   current value         description
--------   --------------------  -----------------------------------------------
SeqVrsn    $(SeqDG)              The parm__.seq file is system specific.
                                 Three versions of the file are provided:
                                   ux - unix version (try this one first)
                                   dg - Data General version
                                   pc - pc version
                                 See doc/config.doc for more details on using
                                 the optimal values and on customizing this
                                 file.
ObjVrsn    $(ObjDG)              There are a few code groups that are system
                                 specific, assumes Data General AViiON.
                                 See below for a description of the variations.
WDNAME     /usr/opt/wrdapp       Path name of directory containing the
                                 required message file, immediately followed
                                 by the directory name and file name.
                                 This is usually the last line in the file.
RECL       2048 bytes            The units used for the record length in an
                                 open statement for a binary direct access
                                 file vary between operating systems, and even
                                 between compilers on the same operating system.
                                 The record length of a WDM file is 512 words,
                                 adjust RECL as appropriate for the compiler.
                                 512 words = 1024 half words = 2048 bytes.
SymTbl     $(SYS_V)              System V library archive automatically
                                 builds a symbol table.  When BSD is used,
                                 the symbol table must be explicitly built,
                                 set SymTbl to $(BSD).
ArOpt      rv                    Library archive options.
FFLAGS     -C -u $(OptDbg)       Fortran compiler flags, assumes Green Hills
                                 on a Data General AViiON.
                                 NOTE:  The names of the C functions in the
                                        library code end in an underscore, but
                                        the underscore is omitted when the 
                                        functions are invoked.  You may need 
                                        to include a linker option in FFLAGS
                                        which will cause compiler-generated 
                                        external names to be postfixed with an 
                                        underscore.
F77        f77                   Fortran compiler name, assumes Green Hills
                                 on a Data General AViiON.
CFLAGS     -ansi $(DbgC)         C compiler flags.
CC         gcc                   C compiler name.
SHELL      /bin/sh               The make file(s) contain commands for the
                                 Bourne shell, sh.  This will override
                                 implementations of make that use the
                                 SHELL environment variable.  If this is
                                 changed, additional changes will probably
                                 have to be made in the make file(s).
shCmd      sh                    The shell command is sh.  If SHELL is
                                 changed, this may need to be modified.

           uscn__.f     screen addressing 
                        * vt - assumes vt100 emulation
                          ux - uses curses

  adwdm    wdop__.f     open binary direct access wdm file.  It
                        is important that wdm files be opened with
                        the correct record length.  The units used
                        in an open statement vary between platforms
                        and even between compilers on the same plat-
                        form.  The record length of a wdm file is
                        512 words.
                        * ux - unix version
           usys__.f     Miscelaneous routines
